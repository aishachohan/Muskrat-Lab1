    <h1>Muskrat Hut Surveying in the Peace Athabasca Delta</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Muskrats,Ondatra zibethicus, are a keystone species in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD). 
    Though their native range spans much of North America, these semi-aquatic mammals are particularly important to 
    the ecosystem and the people of the Peace-Athabasca Delta. Historically, the PAD marshes and wetlands provide habitat 
    for tens of thousands of muskrats. In turn, muskrats assured food for predators and people alike. In the fur trade era, 
    local Indigenous trappers sold thousands of muskrat furs in a season. Muskrats not only provided food and fur to be consumed 
    locally, they were the basis of an economy and a way of life. One land user described muskrats as “the bank”, a reliable source
     of income to buy fuel for skidoos or food for a family <br>

     In 2011, in response to concerns regarding muskrat population dynamics, Parks Canada staff met with Fort Chip 
     community members through the Peace-Athabasca Delta Ecological Monitoring Program (PADEMP), a collaboration of 
     the Mikisew Cree First Nation (MCFN), the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation (ACFN), and Fort Chip Métis Association (FCMA). 
     From that workshop, a long-term monitoring effort known as the PAD Muskrat Survey was born. Every winter field crews composed 
     of Indigenous land users and Parks Canada staff studied muskrat abundance from house counts. The survey method was based upon 
     earlier surveys in the 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s where the number of houses was counted in certain study basins. This allowed new 
     data collected from 2011-2016 to be combined with older surveys in order to track the decrease in muskrat densities over a longer
    period of time.

    Below is a map that shows one example of the various locations where muskrat huts were found in the PAD.
